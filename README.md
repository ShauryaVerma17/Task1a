Area Calculator : Task 1


Use of abstract classes to create a console application for caluclation of areas of triangles and rectangles. 

log4net is used to log data onto text files (RollingFileAppender) as well as onto the console. 

Abstract Class : 'Shape' contains only an abstract function called CalcArea.
Derived Classes : 2 derived classes inherit the base class and contain their own implementatins of how area is to be calculated.




**Running The Application**
Upon Running the application the user simply has to input the required parameters (side lengths) and the applicaiton will return the Area. 
Everything that happens during runtime is logged.
